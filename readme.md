My focus here was a simple UI that allowed usage of OMDB parameters. Despite the 5 hour time limit, I wanted it to be responsive working on every browser and device.

On the landing page I wanted to include a default movie, I didn't have time to make the landing page load up new releases by making a component and page for that. So I did the next best thing, creating a pun with the original set of movies / shows that pop up.

If no movie is found with the given search terms:

OMDB has a LOT more in their API than just movies, I expanded the parameters to take in movies, shows, and games.

I'm currently working on creating the favorites component and the ability to view favorites.
